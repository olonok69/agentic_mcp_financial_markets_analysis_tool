# AAPL Comprehensive Technical Analysis
*Analysis Date: 2024-06-11*
*Current Price: $278.85*

## Executive Summary

AAPL exhibited mixed technical signals across four major quantitative strategies over the past year. Despite a solid uptrend and bullish momentum reflected by moving averages and breakout models, short-term volatility and conflicting signals among mean reversion and trend-following tools suggest both opportunity and risk. The MACD-Donchian strategy stands out, significantly outperforming the market with strong risk-adjusted returns, while the Connors RSI-ZScore approach also outperformed Buy & Hold. However, the Bollinger-Fibonacci and Dual EMA Crossover strategies signaled caution or underperformance at this time.

Key levels identified include notable resistance and support demarcated by Bollinger Bands and recent swing points. The consensus leans slightly bullish with positive momentum, but pockets of risk and the need for tactical entries remain.

## Individual Strategy Analysis

### 1. Bollinger Bands & Fibonacci Retracement
This strategy delivered a 17.52% return, lagging Buy & Hold by 0.5%. Volatility closely matched the underlying but max drawdown was notably lower (-24.20% vs. -33.36%). While trade win rate (52.68%) exceeded 50%, the average return per trade (0.12%) indicated marginal signal quality. At present, %B is near maximum (99.21%), suggesting price hovers at the upper Bollinger Band. The negative BB Score (-49.21) and the current strategy signal both favor a SELL, pointing to an overbought situation and recommending a short position. The support and resistance are best inferred from recent band extremes and Fibonacci retracement levels.

### 2. MACD-Donchian Combined Strategy  
This approach excels, producing a 31.25% return—over 13% above Buy & Hold. Despite only 3 trades and a low win rate (33.33%), risk-adjusted performance is strong (Sharpe 1.027, Return/Risk 0.984). The current MACD score is 0.64 (above the signal line), paired with a Donchian score of 39.84. Price is near the upper Donchian channel (89.84% of range), reflecting trend strength. However, the current combined signal is HOLD. This suggests pausing for a new breakout confirmation before initiating new positions.

### 3. Connors RSI & Z-Score Analysis
This mean reversion strategy outperformed Buy & Hold by 2.9%, with a 20.93% annual return, moderate volatility, and acceptable drawdown. The Sharpe (0.760) and win rate (~51.4%) add confidence. The latest reading is extreme overbought: Connors RSI at 100 and Z-Score at 1.97, yet the combined score (89.68) triggers a strong BUY signal. The model suggests an imminent continuation of upward momentum and recommends entering long positions. Risk remains but is mitigated by tight stop management around recent lows.

### 4. Dual Moving Average Strategy
Despite its traditional trend-following appeal, the 50/200 EMA crossover strategy lost ground this year (-16.91% return, Sharpe -0.406), with two trend reversals captured but both being whipsaws. The latest signal triggered a bullish Golden Cross (50EMA $261.24, 200EMA $237.75) with current price at $278.85 and trend strength at 9.88%. The model remains LONG (BUY signal) based on strong separation, but recent performance caution is warranted.

## Strategy Consensus Analysis

**Signal Breakdown:**
- BUY signals: 2 strategies (Connors RSI-ZScore, Dual MA)
- HOLD signals: 1 strategy (MACD-Donchian)
- SELL signals: 1 strategy (Bollinger-Fibonacci)

**Best Performing Strategy:** MACD-Donchian with +13.22% excess return
**Worst Performing Strategy:** Dual Moving Average with -34.94% excess return

## Risk Assessment
- Volatility remains elevated (~32% across strategies).
- Max drawdowns ranged from -23.9% (Connors RSI-ZScore) to -37.5% (Dual MA), with all strategies except Bollinger-Fibonacci and Connors RSI showing deeper drawdowns than Buy & Hold.
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) were highest for MACD-Donchian (1.03), confirming it as the most efficient risk/reward approach.

## Final Recommendation: **HOLD**

### Rationale
- MACD-Donchian outperforms but currently signals HOLD, awaiting a fresh breakout.
- Strong buy signals coalesce around mean reversion and major moving average trends, but near-term overbought risk is visible on Bollinger Bands and RSI.
- Mixed historical performance between strategies tempers conviction, especially after recent crossovers.
- Drawdown control is moderate; risk/reward improved mainly through tactical entries rather than passive holding.

### Trading Strategy
1. **Current Holders:** Consider partial profit taking if near resistance; maintain a core position but tighten stops below recent swing lows.
2. **New Buyers:** Prefer a pullback to support ($261-$265 zone) or await a MACD/Donchian breakout confirmation before initiating full-sized longs. Enter on mean reversion triggers or upon further Golden Cross confirmation.
3. **Risk Management:** Place stops below primary support ($250); size positions to limit portfolio drawdown to less than 2-3% per trade.

### Key Levels to Watch
- **Resistance:** ~$279 (Upper Bollinger Band, Donchian upper channel)
- **Support:** ~$261 (50-day EMA, mid retracement zone)
- **Stop Loss:** ~$250 (recent swing low/Fibonacci cluster)
