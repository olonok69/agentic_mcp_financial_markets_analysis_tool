# AAPL Comprehensive Technical Analysis
*Analysis Date: 2025-11-30*

## Executive Summary

This integrated technical review for Apple Inc. (AAPL) surveys four uncorrelated quantitative strategies over the past year. Performance among these methods is notably mixed, underscoring the importance of a diversified approach and robust risk controls. Two strategies (MACD-Donchian, Connors-ZScore) generated clear outperformance vs. Buy & Hold, while one classic trend-following method (Dual Moving Average) lagged both the index and its peers. Notably, signals currently show little cross-strategy agreement, emphasizing cautious trading.

The most successful approach was the MACD-Donchian, exhibiting strong returns, a superior Sharpe ratio, and reduced drawdowns. Connors-ZScore delivered moderate outperformance with a mean-reversion tilt, especially in periods of market noise. Bollinger-Fibonacci trailed buy-and-hold and currently emits a SELL signal. The Dual MA system produced substantial underperformance and would have led investors through a sizable drawdown. Overall, there is **no strong consensus** across methodologies; a prudent, moderately defensive stance is warranted.

## Individual Strategy Analysis

**Bollinger-Fibonacci:**  
• Current %B: 99.21%
• Current BB Score: -49.21
• Current Signal: SELL
• Band Position: Within Bands
• Strategy Recommendation: Enter Short Position
* This approach currently issues a SELL signal, having underperformed Buy & Hold by 0.5%. Risk-adjusted returns and Sharpe are slightly lower than passive, with a notably lower drawdown profile vs. holding the stock outright.

**MACD-Donchian:**  
• Current MACD Score: 0.64
• Current Donchian Score: 39.84
• Combined Score: 16.32
• Current Signal: HOLD
• MACD Position: Above Signal
• Donchian Position: 89.84% of channel range
• Strategy Recommendation: Hold Current Position
* Exhibited the highest excess return (+13.22% vs B&H) and the top Sharpe ratio, with well-contained drawdown. Currently, the model suggests HOLD, reflecting an indecisive trend zone.

**Connors-ZScore:**  
• Current Connors RSI: 100.00
• Current Z-Score: 1.97
• Combined Score: 89.68
• Current Signal: BUY
• Strategy Recommendation: Enter Long Position
* Mean-reversion/statistical strategy with good outperformance (+2.90% vs B&H), moderate risk, and relatively elevated trade frequency. The current signal is BUY, favoring tactical long positions on pullbacks.

**Dual Moving Average (50/200 EMA):**  
Strong uptrend - MA separation indicates robust bullish momentum
* Significant underperformance (-34.9% vs. B&H), negative Sharpe, and higher drawdown. Despite signaling a LONG/BUY position now amid a robust uptrend, trailing performance is a concern; use only as a secondary confirmation.

## Risk Assessment

Volatility is high across strategies (>32% annualized); only modest improvement is achieved via active methods. Max drawdowns ranged from -24% (Connors/Bollinger) to -37% (Dual MA). Use modest position sizing: a risk budget of 0.5–1.0% of portfolio capital per trade is suggested. Given cross-strategy disagreement, err on the side of caution until a clear consensus emerges.

## Final Recommendation: **HOLD**

### Entry Strategy

- For mean-reversion primes (Connors-ZScore): enter on technical pullbacks or retests, confirming with volume or secondary signals if possible.
- If trading trend-following models (MACD-Donchian, Dual MA): only engage on decisive breakouts with strong confirmation above recent highs.
- Short exposure (Bollinger-Fib SELL) should be strictly risk-limited, if at all—given overall uptrend context.

### Risk Management

- Use position sizing consistent with total portfolio risk of 0.5–1.0% per trade.
- Place stop losses below swing lows (longs) or above swing highs (shorts), risk/reward at least 2:1.
- If signals remain split/minority, reduce trading frequency and re-evaluate weekly as conditions evolve.
